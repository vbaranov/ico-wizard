      Reserved tokens distribution is the last step of the crowdsale before finalization. You can make it after the end of the last tier or if hard cap is reached. If you reserved more then 100 addresses for your crowdsale, the distribution will be executed in batches with 100 reserved addresses per batch. Amount of batches is equal to amount of transactions
